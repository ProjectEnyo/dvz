					There are five types of dwarfs you can play as.
				</p>
				<h1>Builder</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Builders</strong> start with tools, food and have the ability to <span class="tooltip" title="Create something out of nothing.">conjure</span> every 30 seconds to gain some more stone.
					As a common dwarf, your general goal is to start building walls and aiding the <span class="tooltip" title="Blacksmiths, alchemists, tailors and bakers.">craftsmen</span> so they can gear you up.
				</p>

				<h1>Alchemist</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Alchemists</strong> <span class="tooltip" title="Create something out of something else.">transmute</span> potions.
					If you brew 3 mundane potions, you can use your transmute spell to gain a bunch of potion supplies.
					<br>
					<strong>Blacksmiths</strong> supply you with the redstone you need and you supply <strong>Tailors</strong> with bones.
				</p>

				<h1>Tailor</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Tailors</strong> transmute armour.
					If you craft 3 bread, you can use your transmute spell to gain a bunch of armour.
					<br>
					<strong>Alchemists</strong> supply you with more bones to keep farming and you supply <strong>Blacksmiths</strong> with gold to smelt.
				</p>

				<h1>Blacksmith</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Blacksmiths</strong> transmute weapons.
					If you craft 3 golden clocks, you can use your transmute spell to gain a bunch of weapons.
					<br>
					<strong>Tailors</strong> supply you with gold and you supply <strong>Alchemists</strong> with redstone.
				</p>

				<h1>Baker</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Bakers</strong> transmute food.
					If you smelt 15 brick, you can use your transmute spell to gain a bunch of food.
					<strong>Bakers</strong> are a more standalone dwarf class compared to the other three craftsmen classes.
					You supply all the dwarfs with food.
