					There are five types of dwarfs you can play as.
				</p>
				<h1 class="gray">Builder</h1>
				<p>
					<span class="gray">Builders</span> start with tools, food and have the ability to <span class="tooltip" title="Create something out of nothing.">conjure</span> every 30 seconds to gain some more stone.
					As a <span class="gray">common dwarf</span>, your general goal is to start building walls and aiding the craftsmen so they can gear you up.
				</p>

				<h1 class="indigo">Alchemist</h1>
				<p>
					<span class="indigo">Alchemists</span> <span class="tooltip" title="Create something out of something else.">transmute</span> potions.
					If you brew 3 mundane potions, you can use your transmute spell to gain a bunch of potion supplies.<br>
					<span class="red">Blacksmiths</span> supply you with the redstone you need and you supply <span class="green">Tailors</span> with bones.
				</p>

				<h1 class="green">Tailor</h1>
				<p>
					<span class="green">Tailors</span> <span class="tooltip" title="Create something out of something else.">transmute</span> armour.
					If you craft 3 bread, you can use your transmute spell to gain a bunch of armour.<br>
					<span class="indigo">Alchemists</span> supply you with more bones to keep farming and you supply <span class="red">Blacksmiths</span> with gold to smelt.
				</p>

				<h1 class="red">Blacksmith</h1>
				<p>
					<span class="red">Blacksmiths</span> <span class="tooltip" title="Create something out of something else.">transmute</span> weapons.
					If you craft 3 golden clocks, you can use your transmute spell to gain a bunch of weapons.<br>
					<span class="green">Tailors</span> supply you with gold and you supply <span class="indigo">Alchemists</span> with redstone.
				</p>

				<h1 class="gold">Baker</h1>
				<p>
					<span class="gold">Bakers</span> <span class="tooltip" title="Create something out of something else.">transmute</span> food.
					If you smelt 15 brick, you can use your transmute spell to gain a bunch of food.
					<span class="gold">Bakers</span> are a more standalone dwarf class compared to the other three working classes.
					You supply all the <span class="gray">dwarfs</span> with food.
