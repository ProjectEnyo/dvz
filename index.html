				<h1>The Game</h1>
				<p>
					First off everyone starts out as a Dwarf.
					When you die, you become a monster.
				</p>
				<p>
					The game ends when there are no more Dwarves left,
					Monsters have broken the Dwarf monument,
					or it is time to just start another round.
				</p>
				<p>
					Games typically last 30 to 120 minutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					<!-- img here -->
					This is the Dwarf Monument. Dwarves worship it.
					Do not cover it in stone because
					that is not very dwarf like.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Honour and defend it.</strong>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>The Dwarves</h1>
				<p>
					There are four types of Dwarves you can play as:
					<dl>
						<dt class="gray">Builder</dt>
						<dd><span class="gray">Builders</span> start with tools,
						food and have the ability to transmute
						every 30 seconds to gain some more stone.
						As a <span class="gray">common dwarf</span>, your general goal
						is to start building walls and aiding
						the crafters so they can gear you up.</dd>

						<dt class="indigo">Alchemist</dt>
						<dd><span class="indigo">Alchemists</span> transmute potions.
						If you craft 3 mundane potions,
						you can use your transmute spell
						ato gain a bunch of potion supplies.<br>
						<span class="red">Blacksmiths</span> supply you with the
						redstone you need and you supply
						<span class="green">Tailors</span> with bones.</dd>

						<dt class="green">Tailor</dt>
						<dd><span class="green">Tailors</span> transmute armour.
						If you craft 3 bread, you can
						use your transmute spell to
						gain a bunch of armour.<br>
						<span class="indigo">Alchemists</span> supply you with
						more bones to keep farming
						and you supply <span class="red">Blacksmiths</span>
						with gold to smelt.</dd>

						<dt class="red">Blacksmith</dt>
						<dd><span class="red">Blacksmiths</span> transmute weapons.
						If you craft 3 golden clocks, you
						can use your transmute spell to
						gain a bunch of weapons.<br>
						<span class="green">Tailors</span> supply you with gold and
						you supply <span class="indigo">Alchemists</span> with redstone.
					</dl>

					Dwarves are of course communists. They work together and share!
					Your goal as a dwarf is to gear out yourself and as
					many allies while building defensive structures.
					Until... <strong>SOMEONE DIES!</strong>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>The Monsters</h1>
				<p>
					When someone dies they become a random monster.
					There are <em>Common Monsters</em>,
					<em>Uncommon Monsters</em>, and <em>Rare Monsters</em>.<br>
					Sometimes you get a lot of choices of what to play as,
					and sometimes you have no other option
					but have to play as a <span class="lime">Zombie</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember you cannot pick up items as a monster.
					This means you cannot pick up wood/stone/dirt,
					and eliminates being able to craft or build.
				</p>
				<p>
					A 2 block high wall around a Dwarf base is a nightmare for even
					a player <span class="lime">Zombie</span> in this game.
					But unfortunately there are more than just <span class="lime">Zombies</span> coming.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<dl>
					<dt class="lime">Zombies</dt>
					<dd><span class="lime">Zombies</span> have iron armour and an
					enchanted iron sword. They also get
					2 healing potions so even against
					a fully geared out player, a <span class="lime">Zombie</span>
					who gets the jump on them stands
					a pretty good chance of winning a
					fight.<br>
					Never engage a <span class="lime">Zombie</span> if you
					are undergeared. Fight from range or as a team!<br>
					A <span class="lime">Zombie</span> does not need to kill
					everyone because even a single kill means another <span class="red">monster</span>!</dd>

					<dt class="lime">Skeletons</dt>
					<dd><span class="lime">Skeletons</span> have an enchanted bow
					and leather armour. They have fire resist potions
					and if you do not have the gear,
					stay behind your walls as they can
					kill unarmoured targets very easily.<br>
					They are easy to kill once you
					are geared, but can still do a lot of
					damage in the early to mid game if
					you are not careful.</dd>

					<dt class="lime">Creepers</dt>
					<dd><span class="lime">Creepers</span> have leather armour and a
					single piece of TNT. If you left click
					with the TNT you blow up. You can kill
					weaker armoured targets, but diamond
					armoured players will not die to even a
					direct hit unless wounded.<br>
					<span class="lime">Creepers</span> sometimes do not need to
					kill to be useful as they can simply blow open massive
					holes in walls that if not repaired can
					allow other monsters to pour in!</dd>

					<dt class="lime">Wolves</dt>
					<dd><span class="lime">Wolves</span> are the heavy hitters of monsters.
					As a <span class="lime">Wolf</span>, you are given 5 wolf eggs
					and a stack of bones as well as two
					swords. One is a diamond sword with
					sharpness 2 and the other is a gold
					sword with knockback 2 and flame 2
					allowing you to be both aggressive
					and defensive in one on one combat.<br>
					In combinations with your wolf pack,
					<span class="lime">Wolves</span> are a pain as to tell
					which wolf is the player and which are decoys.<br>
					<span class="lime">Wolves</span> are weaker than
					<span class="lime">Zombies</span> due to lack of healing potions,
					and only chain armour,
					but a wolf who sneaks up on even the most geared out of players, can take
					them down easily if they are not quick to react!</dd>

					<dt class="lime">Spiders</dt>
					<dd><span class="lime">Spiders</span> have a lot of tricks up their
					sleeves and you will never know by
					reading this what “watch out for
					their poisons” means until you
					see it in game.<br>
					They have dual poisons;
					one that impairs your
					vision and another
					that makes you dizzy.
					When combined you become
					completely incapable of seeing
					anything allowing the spider to
					keep poisoning you and slowly kill you.<br>
					<span class="lime">Spiders</span> also have increased movement speed
					and jump height allowing them to
					jump over 5 block high walls.
					They are also equipped with vines allowing them to build
					ladders for the other monsters to get into the keep!</dd>

					<dt class="blue">Snow Golem</dt>
					<dd>The <span class="blue">Snow Golem</span> is an artillery strike unit.
					With no armour or weapons, the <span class="blue">Snow Golem</span>
					has only one purpose; to make snowballs.<br>
					Every minute you can summon a horde of snowballs to use
					and by left clicking them you can throw up to 200 in a wide long range cone,
					allowing you to get into positions and drop a couple volleys
					on the dwarves.<br>
					These snowballs deal 3 hearts of damage each,
					but are known for killing wounded dwarves or knocking them off
					to their death by just sheer volume of projectiles being launched.</dd>

					<dt class="yellow">Iron Golem</dt>
					<dd><span class="yellow">Iron Golems</span> are the siege units for the
					monsters. They move at an insanely
					slow speed and cannot jump up blocks.
					This means without the support of a
					team mate, you are forced for the most
					part to tunnel your way slowly to the
					dwarves base. They are however
					insanely hard to kill <em>anything</em> in melee range.<br>
					<span class="yellow">Iron Golems</span> have two abilities;
					one allows them to smash the blocks in front of them
					flattening the area, and the other
					allows them to leap once every 30 seconds
					great heights in the air.
					The leap can be used to get out of holes you fall into or
					even jump on a dwarf who thinks they are far enough away.<br>
					The flaw of an <span class="yellow">Iron Golem</span>
					is that their armour breaks quickly, and focus firing an
					<span class="yellow">Iron Golem</span> can make them very weak.
					However, the ability to create tunnels
					as well as tank damage makes them a massive
					threat to the dwarves and a huge distraction
					for the rest of the team.</dd>

					<dt class="purple">Broodmother</dt>
					<dd>The <span class="purple">Broodmother</span> is a silverfish
					who does what silverfish do best; make more silverfish.
					As a <span class="purple">Broodmother</span>, your goal
					is to get close enough to the dwarf walls and start laying eggs.
					Once a couple are laid down, you begin roaring to awaken them.<br>
					A <span class="purple">Broodmother</span> who is not quickly dealt
					with, will cause massive amounts of silverfish to spawn inside
					the dwarven base, but the real threat is the amount
					of damage she can cause to walls and the friendly fire dwarves
					will deal to each other trying to kill silverfish in a
					small space.</dd>

					<dt class="red">Enderman</dt>
					<dd>The <span class="red">Enderman</span> have no armour
					and 2 abilities. One allows them to teleport insane
					distances once every 20 seconds
					and the other to turn themselves into a portal
					allowing all monsters to teleport to the <span class="red">Enderman</span>.
					When doing so the sky turns dark and a lightning bolt
					will constantly strike the <span class="red">Enderman</span> every time
					it reinforces the portal to allow more monsters to teleport.<br>
					The <span class="red">Enderman</span> will also slowly be able to spawn an
					assortment of normal monsters and drop them down from the portal.
					Dwarves can use the end stone being summoned to shut down the portal,
					but the <span class="red">Enderman</span> can reopen it.
					Dwarves have to find a vantage point to try and kill the <span class="red">Enderman</span>,
					or try climb up and take him down.
					The <span class="red">Enderman</span> portal can quickly shift a game into a downward
					spiral for the dwarves if it is not quickly dealt with.
