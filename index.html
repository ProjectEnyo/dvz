					<strong>Dwarfs vs. Zombies</strong> on Project Enyo (or Enyo DVZ) is an attempt to recreate the old school <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarvesVsZombies">Dwarfs vs. Zombies</a> from scratch, using the same or similar plugins as the original concept.
					<br>
					We run occasional games	that are streamed on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/brottweiler">Twitch.tv</a>.

				<h2>The Game</h2>
				<h3>Phase 1 — Preparations</h3>
				<p>
					Joining the server will spawn you on a platform with other players. When an admin starts the game, everyone will get a <strong>magma cream</strong> which can be left clicked to get some random discs. Each disc represents a different <a href="dwarf.html">dwarf class</a>.
					There is always a chance to get the Builder disc, but you may get other discs as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using a disc will teleport you to the <span class="tooltip" title="An obsidian structure with enchanting tables.">dwarf monument</span>, and you will get a kit of items depending on which class you choose.
					<br>
					It is the <span class="tooltip" title="Also known as builder dwarfs.">common dwarfs</span> general goal to start building walls and aiding the <span class="tooltip" title="Blacksmiths, alchemists, tailors and bakers.">craftsmen</span> so they can gear you up.
				</p>
				<p style="overflow:auto;">
					<img src="img/monument.png" class="shrine left">
					This is the Dwarf Monument. Dwarfs worship it. Do not cover it in stone because that is not very dwarf like.
					<strong>Honour and defend it.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Dwarfs are of course communists. They work together and share!
					Your goal as a dwarf is to gear out yourself and as many allies while building defensive structures.
					Until... <strong>SOMEONE DIES!</strong>
				</p>
				<h3>Phase 2 — Attacks</h3>
				<p>
					After a few nights, a dwarf will die. When a dwarf dies, they become a random monster.
					<br>
					There are <em>Common Monsters</em>, <em>Uncommon Monsters</em>, and <em>Rare Monsters</em>.
					When you die, you receive a <strong>broken disc</strong> that when left clicked, will give you some random monster eggs.
					Each egg represents a <a href="monster.html">monster class</a>.
					Sometimes you get a lot of choices of what to play as, and sometimes you have no other option but have to play as a Zombie.
					<br>
					Selecting a monster class, you will get a kit of items and be teleported to the monster spawn.
					Depending on what monster you are, you will have different abilities.
					Monsters can break blocks but cannot pick up any items or craft things.
				</p>
				<h3>Phase 3 — Progress</h3>
				<p>
					When a monster starts to attack, it is a question of time until another dwarf dies.
					The builder dwarfs must have built a strong base to keep the monsters out.
					A two block high wall around a dwarf base is a nightmare for even a player Zombie in this game.
					But unfortunately there are more than just Zombies coming.
				</p>
				<h3>Phase 4 — Ending</h3>
				<p>
					The game ends when there are no more dwarfs left alive, monsters have broken the Dwarf Monument, or it is time to just start another round.
					Games typically last 30 to 120 minutes.
					<br>
					<strong>...and sooner or later everyone will become a monster and the game restarts.</strong>
